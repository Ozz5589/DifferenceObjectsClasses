# DifferenceObjectsClasses
A class serves as a blueprint or prototype that defines the properties and behaviors of objects derived from it. It does not represent a specific instance but outlines a template for creating objects. Classes are declared using the “class” keyword, followed by the class name and a block that contains variables and methods. An object, on the other hand, is a specific instance of a class. When a class is instantiated, it generates an object that holds actual values instead of the variables outlined in the class. Objects can interact with one another and alter their state. They are instantiated using the “new” keyword. Classes encapsulate the abstract concept of entities that share similar properties and behaviors, while objects are concrete instances that reflect those definitions with their unique data and states. 

Key points on Classes:
•	Abstract representation; serves as a template or model.
•	Defines the structure and behavior that the objects will follow.
•	It exists in memory as a blueprint; it doesn't consume much memory itself until instantiated.
•	It cannot be used directly; it must be instantiated to work with it.


Key points on Objects: 
•	Concrete instance; represents real-world entities.
•	Contains actual data values and can perform actions defined in the class.
•	Allocates memory for the actual data (attributes) when created.
•	It can be manipulated directly in the code after creation; it represents the points where definitions become functional.
